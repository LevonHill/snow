// Service portal Themes Introduction
Service Portal allows you to build a mobile-friendly self-service experience for your users. It interacts with parts of the Now Platform, so users can access specific platform features using Service Portal. It is an alternative to the Content Management System (CMS) based on more modern technologies.

1.To apply an existing theme to a Service Portal, navigate to Service Portal > Portals in your base instance and select your Service Portal. An instance can have multiple Service Portals for different company needs.

The Service Portal that you are currently using is highlighted with a small dot next to the portal name. You can modify other Service Portals, but you won't see those changes unless you switch to the other Service Portal. This requires logging out and logging back into the correct Service Portal.

LAB1 

Apply Service Portal Themes
Before you start

This lab is broken into two sections. In the first section, you are instructed to configure your ServiceNow instance with specific parameters. You are not given specific instructions on how to accomplish this, but rather given the goals that you will work towards. If you feel confident that you can accomplish these goals without any assistance, then you are encouraged to dive in and complete the tasks.

In the second section, the steps required to meet the goals from the first section are clearly described. You can use this section to double-check your work. If you are not comfortable with completing the tasks on your own, you can use this section as a walkthrough to complete the tasks.

Section 1: Your goal for this practice lab

Configure your ServiceNow instance so that it meets the following criteria.

•
Change the Service Portal Theme to Stock - High Contrast.

PART 2 - Service Portal Headers and Footers
While themes are typically used to modify the color scheme of a Service Portal, you can also use themes to display additional information. Headers and footers appear at the top or bottom of a page in the portal. They are controlled by the portal theme. Make sure you have a basic understanding of HTML or CSS before making any changes to a header or footer.
To create or modify either a header or a footer, navigate to Service Portal > Headers & Footers.

![alt text](image-4.png)


1st -Name
The name you provide for the header or footer.  It is best to be descriptive by including the purpose of the header or footer and indicating if this is designed to be a header or footer.
Example: Legal Disclaimer Footer

2nd- HTML

The HTML code that is used to generate the header or footer.

3rd- The CSS styles that are used to modify the format of the HTML code. Note in this example how the CSS is given a name (.sample-footer) and that name is referenced as the class (class="sample-footer") in the HTML code.

4th-A mandatory widget component.

A server script requires knowledge of the ServiceNow API to work with record data. Use the server script to:
Set the initial state of the widget.
Send record data to the widget client script using the data variable.
Run server-side queries.
Set the initial state of the widget.
Send record data to the widget client script using the data variable.
Run server-side queries.

5th -Client Controller

A mandatory widget component.A client script requires knowledge of both the ServiceNow API and AngularJS to create a client controller. Use the client script to:
Map server data from JavaScript and JSON objects to client objects.
Process data before rendering it.
Pass data to the HTML template.
Pass user input and data back to the server for processing.

6th controller As
By default, widgets use the c controller as variable to represent the controller instance by syntax. You can change this variable when creating or cloning a widget.

7th LinkAn optional widget component.
The link function requires knowledge of AngularJS. Use a link function to directly manipulate the DOM.

Notes:
Headers and Footers can also be applied at the application level. To learn more about applications, attend the Application Development Fundamentals(opens in a new tab) course.

Additional advanced options (Server Script, Client Controller, etc.) are also available, but these topics are beyond the scope of this training.

Instead of modifying a header or footer, consider using the "Clone Widget" option (located on the title bar and at the bottom of the screen). This feature allows you to make changes to a header or footer without risking losing existing formatted data.
