What is Platform Analytics?

ServiceNow data can be viewed and analyzed (in real-time or over time) by you and your colleagues. Data can be visually represented in many ways, including bar charts, pie charts, dials, lists, pivot tables, donuts, and more. 

Visualizations can be run manually or scheduled to run automatically. There are a range of predefined visualizations that pertain to applications and features like Incident Management and Service Catalog requests, including Key Performance Indicator (KPI) charts. 
You can create your own visualizations by navigating to All > Platform Analytics > Analytics Center module. From there, you may select Create new dashboard or Create New visualization.
